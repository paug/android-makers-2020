All our tools were sluggish, the coding experience was terrible, and productivity was getting lower and lower even though we were adopting the best practices of the industry such as having a modularized codebase, and using design patterns like Dependency Injection.\r\n\r\nThis talk for advanced developers is about the journey to improve the Gradle based tools of the Android ecosystem. It will explain how we learnt to debug them, profile them, and improve the whole toolchain. \r\n\r\nAfter a few months, during which we developed a tighter partnership with Jetbrains, Gradle and Google, we are now in a better shape: the IDEs are responsive, our build is faster, productivity is higher, and we are contributing to make the future versions of the tools even better. \r\n",

This test suite was still being maintained by a single hero developer, who, through sheer grit and determination, didn‚Äôt let this important part of our release process die. Armed with experience in functional UI testing, we embarked on an adventure to make our end-to-end test suite a shared responsibility of the entire team.

It becomes easy to forget that every decision you make will affect how it is used, or in the worst case, abused. We're told that code should document itself, but how do these design decisions reflect in the understanding of intended use?\r\n\r\nJust because we might not be exposing a module as a public or open-sourced library, doesn't mean we can't benefit from making good decisions towards an effective and sensible API. By taking the stance that every piece of code we write is an API we can build more versatile and scalable applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how you can apply best practices from the open-source world to your project, to guard implementations, provide concise and specific contracts, practical documentation mechanisms, and how doing so can aid (or harm) your build time.",

Backwards compatibility is still a thing, and memory can definitely still be a deciding factor when making design decisions for your software. \r\n\r\nIf your goal is to store large bitmaps (or other array-based data) in memory, the estimations are easy enough. However, if you're storing complex structures of objects, the actual memory size of the data can be difficult to evaluate. In this talk, I'll go over the memory structure of the JVM and how much memory an instance of a given class uses. I'll then present a way to examine objects at runtime, to assess exactly how much memory they & the objects they reference are using up. Using this method, I'll look at some data structures that were designed to optimize memory usage, and give an estimate of their real impact over more conventional data structures.",

With October release of Robolectric 4.0 and androidx.test 1.0.0, both testing environments are converging on a set of common test APIs. Robolectric now supports the AndroidJUnit4 test runner, ActivityTestRule, and Espresso for interacting with UI components.",

However, we can learn it using an opposite approach and learn it better. This talk is going to discuss about that reverse approach to learn dagger.\r\n\r\nInstead of learning what is @Component and how to use it, this talk first goes through something\r\nwhich doesn't have any DI and then discuss about the ways to inject the dependencies manually. In this\r\njourney of migrating from \"No DI\" to \"Manual DI\", we will end up at a place where our codebase looks\r\nsomewhat similar to dagger's generated code. Now is the time to replace those with proper dagger annotations and make it a journey from \"Manual DI\" to \"Dagger\".\r\n\r\nIn this journey, we will see a lot of Dagger's generated code first (as if we wrote them ourselves) and\r\nthen Dagger's annotations. This will make everyone visualise which Dagger annotation is doing what job and which should be used when.",

The lesser the size the probability of increasing downloads will be more. Smaller is always faster such as download, install, startup. Here comes R8 which is a shrinking technique to shrink your app size. It uses Tree Shaking, Optimization for size, Minification(Obfuscation) techniques.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the outline of the talk:\r\n1. How R8 evolved from Java Compiler, Dex Compiler, Proguard, D8.\r\n2. What are keep rules?\r\n3. What is shrinking in R8?\r\n4. How much you can save using R8?\r\n5.
